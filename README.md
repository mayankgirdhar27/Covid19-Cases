I am currently working on this app as this is my final year project. 

An app for the local law enforcement to capture and store digital evidence on the device. 
The person using the app can give notes on stored evidence.
Audit Trail is being maintained of all the activity and evidence capture.

CoreData is using one-to-many relationships to manage the data. 
CoreData is being used to manage the data in the app. I am using Documents directory to store files like videos and photos. And then storing the link(URL) of the documents directroy in CoreData with other information. and then fetching back data from CoreData.
