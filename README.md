# Private Eye

UI/UX - SwiftUI

Data Persistence - Core Data Stack.

I developed this app App for my Final Year Project.
An app for the local law enforcement to capture and store digital evidence on the device. A User can create multiple cases and store case details and digital evidence in the app. A password screen is also implemented.
I am Using the Documents directory to store files like videos/photos. Users can import multiple photos/videos in the app using a custom implemented PHPicker. The link of the imported media (Documents Directory URL to media) is stored in CoreData to fetch and display media in the app. Core Data stores the text-based case details.
