# Private Eye

I am currently working on this app as my final year project.
An app for the local law enforcement to capture and store digital evidence on the device.
Using Documents directory to store files like videos & photos picked using PHPicker from
the users phone library.
CoreData is used to store the data in the App. Using one to many relationship to store all
the data.
Link of the stored media(Documents Directory URL to media) is stored in CoreData to
fetch and display media in the app.
